# Prototypiacl Networks

As shown in the reference paper Prototypical Networks are trained to embed samples features in a vectorial space, in particular, at each episode (iteration), a number of samples for a subset of classes are selected and sent thourgh the model, for each subset of class 'c' a number of samples'features ('n_support') are used to guess the prototype (their baricentre coordinates in the vactorial space) for that class, so then the distances between the remaining 'n_query' samples and their class baricentre can be minimized.

# T-SNE 

After training for X epochs, we can compute the t-sne for the features generated by the model, this is our results compared to results obtained in the paper

# Omniglot dataset

Kudos to [@ludc](https://github.com/ludc) for his contribute: https://github.com/pytorch/vision/pull/46.
We will use the official dataset when it will be added to torchvision if it doesn't imply big changes to the code.

# Prototypical Batch Sampler

As described in its PyDoc, this class is used to generate the indexes of each batch for a ptrototypical training algorithm.

In particular, the object is instantiated by passing the list of the labels for the dataset, the sampler inferes then the total number of classes and creates a set of indexes for each class ni the dataset. At each episode the sampler selects 'n_classes' random classes and returns a number (n_support + n_query) of samples indexes for each one of the selected classes.

# Prototypical Loss

Compute the loss as in the cited paper, mostly inspired by [this code](https://github.com/jakesnell/prototypical-networks/blob/master/protonets/models/few_shot.py) by one of its authors.

In particular, the functions takes in input the batch output from the model, the samples ground trhuths and the number 'n_suppport' of samples to be used as support samples, so the function inferes the episode classes from the target list, randomly extracts 'n_support' samples for each class, computes their class baricentre, computes the distances of each remaining samples' embeddings from each class baricentre and compute the probability of each samples of belonging to each episode class; The loss is then computed from the wrong predictions probabilities (for the query smaples) as usual in classification problems.


# Training

Please note that the training code is here just for demonstration purposes. It use a pretrained resnet model as feature extractor and train only the last layer as a classifier.
